# 👋 Hello, I'm Benyamin Khalife!

I'm a **Full-Stack Developer** with over **10 years of experience** in designing and building custom web applications, Telegram bots, and high-performance systems. I am the creator of several open-source frameworks, focusing on extreme optimization and developer experience.

🔭 **Currently working on**: Scaling my open-source ecosystem and building high-performance web solutions.  
🌱 **Currently learning**: Deepening my expertise in **Rust** to build next-generation system architectures.  
👯 **Open to collaboration**: On innovative frameworks, Telegram bot ecosystems, or complex web systems.  
📫 **Reach me**: BenKhalifeDev@gmail.com  
⚡ **Fun fact**: PHP is not dead. 😒 (I even built a framework for it!)
